Manga-Organizer
===============

<p align="justify">As a mild hoarder I found that a folder hierarchy simply doesn't cut it when you have hundreds of folders to manage. No tagging, no automation, labyrinthine directory structures; it simply becomes a mess to find anything. So I got fed up with it and wrote a program to handle all of this properly.</p>

<p align="justify">It basically provides semi-automated metadata for your manga, EH-style searches, and the option to use a built-in 2-page image browser. When first ran, either press the 'Scan' button or drag your folders/archives onto the listview. This will fill out the artist, title, and page count fields. Other tags can be loaded from an EH gallery URL, dragged into the 'Tags' textbox, or added manually.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
- no install required
- searches function similarly to EH's<br />
  (eg. title:celeb_wife date:>01/01/12 -vanilla)
- entry data can be automatically loaded from an EH gallery URL
- 'auto-magic' also applies to copy/pasted tags, gallery titles, and folders or archives dropped onto the listview
- browse images with your default image viewer (Menu -> Open) or with the built in one (click on the cover image)
- the latter browser displays two images simultaneously and should be traversed from right to left
- to un-ignore an item in the scan operation, select it and press the ignore button again
- if you set the root folder (Menu -> Settings -> Root Folder) to the root of your manga directory, the program will try to auto-find the correct path when new items are added.
- open 'Menu -> About' to automatically check for an updated version
